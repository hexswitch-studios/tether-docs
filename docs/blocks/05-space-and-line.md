# Space and line

The Space and Line block lets you fine-tune spacing between blocks in your section layout. Itâ€™s a flexible design utility that helps improve visual flow and separation. You can use it to add extra vertical space, insert a horizontal customizable line, or both.

## Adding the block

Add the Space and line block to your section blocks using the Theme Editor.

The Space and line block is available as a general content block. All sections that allow for general content blocks have access to the Space and line block.

 More complicated sections require specific content to look and feel right. These sections do not have access to general content blocks.

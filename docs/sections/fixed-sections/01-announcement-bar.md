### Scroll advancement

The scroll advencement style is similar to the Marquee section. The scroller will pause when a user has hovered over it.

Control the scroll speed using the "Scroll speed" range setting.

:::note

The scroll speed is calculated using a fairly complex math equation that factors the amount of content within a marquee scroller and how much width the content takes.

You may need to adjust the scroll speed after altering your content.

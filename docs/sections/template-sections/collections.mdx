| Setting               | Description                                                                 |

| **Color scheme**         | Select a predefined color scheme. |
| **Show collection description**         | Choose whether to display the collection’s description. |
| **Show collection image**         | Choose whether to display the collection’s featured image. |
| **Image layout**         | Show the collection image as either a hero with overlaid text, or a separate side by side layout. |
| **Details in hero style**         |  Choose to use a gradient that blends or contrasts the image to improve readability. Only applies if showing as hero. |
| **Image display width**         |  Choose whether the image stays within the theme's normal padding or extends beyond it for a more immersive layout. Extended allows the image to break out of the usual bounds, while within bounds keeps it aligned with the page content. |

# Cart template

The Cart template controls the layout and content of the cart page. It displays the products a customer has added to their cart, along with quantities, prices, and a checkout button.

:::info
The Cart template is only accessible by updating the page url to `/cart` unless the quick cart is disabled.

If the Quick cart is disabled a user can access the cart template via the cart button in the header.

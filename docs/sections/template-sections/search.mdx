# Search template

The Search template displays results when a customer uses your store’s search feature. It shows matching products, collections, blog posts, or pages based on the search term entered. You can customize this template to include filters, sorting options, or messaging to help customers quickly find what they’re looking for.

:::tip Quick search
If the [Quick search](#TODO) is enabled users will be able to actively search within the header without needed to visit this template. This template is still visible to people looking for full results beyond what is shown in the Quick search results.

# Shop the look

The Shop the look section allows you to showcase a styled image, and tag individual products featured in the scene. Customers can browse the full look and quickly add items to their cart, making it easy to shop complete outfits or coordinated sets. It’s a great way to inspire purchases and highlight how products work together in context.

:::note
Clicking on the hotspot will overlay the content with a coursel of products on desktop sizes and open a drawer showing your product on mobile.

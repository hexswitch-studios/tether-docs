# Recently viewed

The Recently viewed section shows customers the items they’ve recently looked at while browsing your store. This makes it easier for shoppers to return to products they were interested in without needing to search again—helping reduce friction and improve the shopping experience. It’s especially useful on longer shopping journeys or stores with large product catalogs.

:::tip
The recently viewed section will not be visible to users until they have viewed a product page.

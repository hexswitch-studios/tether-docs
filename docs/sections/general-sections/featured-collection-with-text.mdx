# Featured collection with text

The Featured collection with text section showcases products from a selected collection in a single-column layout, alongside nested block content. As customers scroll through the products, the text remains fixed, allowing your message to stay visible. It’s perfect for storytelling, sharing product details, or reinforcing a promotion while shoppers browse.

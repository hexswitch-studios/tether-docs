# Related products

The Related Products section helps customers discover more items they may be interested in by displaying products related to the one they’re currently viewing. This section can increase engagement and average order value by suggesting complementary or similar products.

By default, related products are automatically generated based on Shopify’s internal logic. For more control, you can use the Shopify [Search & Discovery](https://apps.shopify.com/search-and-discovery) app to manually customize product recommendations and fine-tune what appears based on the displayed product.

# Marquee

The Marquee section displays a continuous, horizontal scrolling row of content—such as text, images, or icon. It's a dynamic way to showcase product highlights, or promotional messages while adding motion and energy to the page.

:::note Scroll speed

The scroll speed is calculated using a fairly complex math equation that factors the amount of content within a marquee scroller and how much width the content takes.

You may need to adjust the scroll speed after altering your content.

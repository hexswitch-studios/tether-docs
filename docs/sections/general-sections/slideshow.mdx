# Slideshow

The Slideshow section allows you to display multiple slides that transition either automatically or manually. This is a great way to highlight promotions, feature products, or tell a visual story.

## Slide block

Each slide in the Slideshow section includes its own content and styling options. These settings control the appearance and layout of the individual slide.

| Setting                  | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| **Color scheme**         | Select a predefined color scheme. The background color is used for overlays. |
| **Image overlay opacity**| Adds a semi-transparent overlay on top of the image using the selected scheme background. Use this to improve text readability. |
| **Desktop image**        | Select the default image. |
| **Mobile image** `*`         | _Optional_. Upload a different image optimized for smaller screens. If left blank, the desktop image will be used on all devices. |
| **Slide content**         | [See shared block settings > Overlay content](#overlay-content). Associated settings below. |

:::info Avoid layout shifts
If Section height is set to Slide height, you can avoid layout shifts by using slide images that use the same aspect ratio.

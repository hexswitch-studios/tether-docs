# Typography

Customize the overall look and feel of your store’s text with global typography controls. Choose fonts for body text and headings, adjust font sizes, line height, and letter spacing to improve readability and visual balance.

## Heading scaling settings

Control how headings scale in relation to each other. Each heading size is based on the one before it, creating a consistent visual hierarchy. Increasing the scale makes each level of heading larger compared to the previous one, while decreasing it keeps the sizes closer together.

Heading scaling is also corelated to the [Body font size](#body-size).

| Setting               | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mobile scale**         | Set your heading typescale for mobile sizes screens. |
| **Desktop scale**         | Set your heading typescale for desktop sizes screens. |

:::tip
For a smooth, consistent experience across devices, avoid setting desktop and mobile heading scales too far apart. Keeping the sizes relatively close helps maintain visual balance and prevents awkward jumps in layout or readability.

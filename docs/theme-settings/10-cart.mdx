## Free shipping bar

Display a message in the cart that encourages customers to reach a free shipping threshold. As items are added, the message updates to show how close they are to qualifyingâ€”helping boost average order value. The free shipping bar requires a custom Metaobject to setup the threshold, view the step by step tutorial [here](/getting-started/setting-up-the-free-shipping-metaobject).

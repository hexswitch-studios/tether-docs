# Corner styling

Corner styling allows you to customize the corner appearance of elements across your store by adjusting border radius. You can control the roundness of media (such as images and videos) as well as interactive elements like buttons and input fields. This gives you the flexibility to match your brandâ€™s style. Whether you prefer clean, sharp corners or a softer, more rounded look.

| Setting    | Description                            |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Media border radius**              | Applies to all image and video media across the site. Does not apply if media is using 'Display width' -> 'Extended'              |
| **Interactive elements border radius**     | Applies to all buttons, inputs, and other UI elements across your theme. |

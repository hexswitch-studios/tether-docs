# Quick search

The Quick search provides instant search results as customers type, helping them find products, collections, or pages faster. Results appear in a dropdown below the search field, allowing shoppers to quickly jump to relevant content without leaving the current page.

:::note
If the Quick search is disabled, clicking on the search icon in the header will redirect the user to the Search template.

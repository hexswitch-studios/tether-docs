# Wishlist

The wishlist lets customers save products they’re interested in for later. It’s a simple feature. Users can add or remove items from their list, making it easier to keep track of favorites while browsing. It’s a helpful tool for customers who aren’t ready to purchase but want to revisit products in the future.

## Swatch selectors

Swatch selectors let shoppers quickly preview and select product variants using color pattern selectors instead of traditional dropdown menus.

| **Shape**         | Choose to display your swatches as either round or square (Corner styling applies). |

## Chip selectors

Chip selectors display product variant options—like size, material, or style—as clickable buttons. They’re clean, easy to scan, and ideal for text-based choices. Chip selectors help customers quickly understand what’s available and make selections without using dropdowns.

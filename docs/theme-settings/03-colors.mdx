# Colors

Customize your store’s look and feel using flexible color schemes. Instead of choosing individual colors for each element, sections and components are styled using predefined schemes that ensure consistent, balanced color pairings across your storefront. This makes it easy to maintain a cohesive design while giving you the flexibility to update your brand’s palette in just a few clicks.

## Color schemes

Each color scheme includes the following customizable color roles:

| Color    | Description                            |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Background**              | The main background color used wherever the scheme is applied.              |
| **Background Gradient**     | An optional gradient overlay for the background. Available in select sections to add visual depth and color emphasis. |
| **Text**                    | The primary foreground color used for text, icons, and borders.             |
| **Primary Button Background** | The background color for primary buttons throughout your store.             |
| **Primary Button Text**     | The text color used on primary buttons. Ensures clear contrast and readability. |
| **Secondary Button Color**  | The color used for secondary (outline) buttons—applied to both text and borders. |

## Accent colors

Accent colors highlight your brand’s identity and add emphasis to key elements. These colors are applied across all color schemes, and can be enabled within any section. This ensures consistency without having to repeat your brand colors in every scheme.
